Welcome to the Technical Wiki of Hello World Team! Currently the wiki contains only the electronics & control part. 

**The Electronic & Control Wiki**  describes the work of the electronic & control group and provides a guide to the development, testing, and contribution process. In addition, we are currently developing self-developed components for both *Robotic Components* and *Embedded System Support*, and detailed documentation for these will also be stored in the wiki.

Wiki for other technical groups are to be developed.
